      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a first-year student at Ashoka University, currently pursuing a major in Economics and Finance . My academic journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity for economic policies and financial systems, further reinforced through projects like my analysis of Indiaâ€™s disinvestment policy.

Iâ€™m passionate about exploring innovative solutions to financial challenges and am particularly interested in how finance can drive social impact. As I continue to grow my knowledge in both finance and other areas, I am eager to engage in opportunities that allow me to apply my skills and learn from experienced professionals in the field.
